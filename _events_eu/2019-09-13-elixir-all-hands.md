After the successful launch of ELIXIR Belgium in 2017, the first [ELIXIR Belgium All Hands Meeting](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/events/elixir-belgium-all-hands-meeting-2019) takes place on 16 September 2019 in Brussels. In this event, we bring together all stakeholders of ELIXIR Belgium, showcase our achievements and plans for the future, as well as provide networking opportunities to meet the people involved.
During this event UseGalaxy.be will be officially launched by Frederik Coppens.
