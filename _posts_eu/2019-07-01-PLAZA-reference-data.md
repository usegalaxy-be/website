Reference data for Plant species at UseGalaxy.be is directly streamed from [PLAZA data warehouse](https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/). If you want to install this set of reference data directly into your Galaxy instance check out [this repo](https://github.com/ieguinoa/galaxy_data_management). To handle other (non-plants) reference data a set of helpful scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/ieguinoa/genomes_to_galaxy).
This work was presented during the [2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019) held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-8 July.
