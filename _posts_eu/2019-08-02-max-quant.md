The Belgian Galaxy server now contains the latest MaxQuant tool wrapper.
[One](https://usegalaxy.be/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/maxquant/maxquant/1.6.3.4) featuring options for SILAC and label free
quantification and also the possibility to process
fractioned data by uploading an experimental design template.

This wrapper, together with [the other wrapper available](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/maxquant_mqpar/maxquant_mqpar/1.6.3.4) have been developed by Damian Glaetzer and Friedel Drepper from the University of Freiburg and are available in the Galaxy ToolShed for everyone.
Thanks a lot Damian and Friedel!

The work was presented at the [GCC2019](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/) and the [slides](https://f1000research.com/slides/8-1162) and the 
[poster](/assets/media/Poster_15C_GCC2019_MaxQuant_Galaxy_20190701_print.pdf) are available.
